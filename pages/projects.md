### <a name="mobile eye-tracking"></a>mobile eye-tracking

Lauren is currently using [Pupil Labs'](https://pupil-labs.com/){:target="_blank"} mobile eye-tracking headsets in a variety of music/neuroscience projects. More details coming soon.

For anyone considering purchasing from Pupil Labs, Lauren has written up a [short guide of considerations](http://lkfink.github.io/pages/PupilLabs_aBeginnersGuide.html){:target="_blank"}.

Lauren is using eye-tracking and Tomic and Janata's (2008) [Beyond-the-Beat model](http://atonal.ucdavis.edu/projects/musical_spaces/rhythm/btb/){:target="_blank"} to predict dynamic attention to musical scenes. More details coming soon.

The code for this project is currently being developed and will eventually be publicly available. Check back in a few months for more details.

### <a name="MET"></a>Conference on Music and Eye-Tracking
[![METimage](../../assets/publpics/METimage.png)](https://lkfink.github.io/pages/publpics/METimage.html)  

The [Conference on Music & Eye-Tracking](https://www.ae.mpg.de/met17), was organized by Lauren Fink and [Elke Lange](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/the-institute/people/lange.html). MET was held 17-18 August 2017 at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Frankfurt, Germany. <br/>

We have arranged for a special issue with selected presentations from the conference to be published in the [Journal of Eye Movement Research](http://www.eyemovementresearch.com/). Submissions are currently being accepted and will be published on a rolling basis, beginning winter 2018.

### <a name="SOMA"></a>SOMA: Seminar Outreach for Minority Advocacy
SOMA is a collaborative project with fellow neuroscience graduate student [Milagros Copara](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Milagros_Copara){:target="_blank"} to enhance diversity within UC Davis and our neuroscience graduate group. We have received funding from the UC Davis [Diversity Inclusion and Innovation Grant](http://studentaffairs.ucdavis.edu/campus-diversity/diversity-inclusion/dii/index.html){:target="_blank"}.  

**Abstract:**
Despite the enthusiasm of the Neuroscience Graduate Group for increasing diversity, there exists a lack of training and awareness regarding diversity-related issues. Adding to this deficit, few underrepresented minorities are invited to give seminars, creating an illusion among our group that success as a minority is rare - a sentiment counter to our stated goals, as well as the retention of our diverse student population. To enhance the visibility of successful underrepresented minorities in neuroscience and educate our campus community about psychological issues that contribute to continued oppression of minority groups, we plan to organize a speaker series consisting of scientists from underrepresented backgrounds. Half of these speakers will be from cellular or systems neuroscience backgrounds, while the other half will be from social neuroscience, speaking on their research related to the neuroscience of implicit bias, race relations, gender, etc. All invited speakers will be asked to begin their seminar with a description of their journeys in academia as a minority. We hope this opportunity to share personal stories will enhance the awareness of underrepresented stories in academia. Potential invited speakers include Tiffany Ito who studies the neural correlates of prejudice and Ben Barres - a transgender man who speaks about gender bias in academia, as well as the function of neural glial cells. Each seminar will be followed by lunch, allowing students the opportunity to interact with the speaker on a personal level. All talks will be open to the entire campus community; lunches will be reserved for neuroscience graduate students.  


**Statement of Problem**
Demographics within neuroscience vastly mismatch the actual distribution of minority communities within the United States population [1]. In a 2011 survey report of 97 U.S. neuroscience graduate programs, only 12% of predoctoral trainees were minorities (African- American, Hispanic-American, Native-American, “Other”) - a statistic that reduces to only 4% of postdoctoral trainees and 5% of tenure track faculty [2]. Increasing the visibility of underrepresented scientists is a critical component to addressing this inequity. Without visibility, the aforementioned unequal distributions are inevitably perpetuated. At UC Davis, there is a marked underrepresentation of individuals belonging to marginalized communities who are
invited to communicate their research. Our project will provide a platform for scientific researchers to share a diverse set of ideas and perspectives, upholding Goals 3 and 4 of the UC Davis Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan. This unique exchange will be further developed through dialogue between our speakers and students in social spaces, like pre- seminar lunches and post-seminar dinners, which will hopefully lead to fruitful professional networks and mentorship opportunities.

**Objectives**
- Enhance the visibility of underrepresented scientists
- Give underrepresented scientists a broader platform to reach the scientific community, especially aspiring young scientists
- Facilitate candid dialogue between underrepresented faculty and students, particularly regarding their journeys in academia
- Establish research connections and possible collaborations between our invited speakers and researchers at UC Davis
