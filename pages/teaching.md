*Student ratings and reviews from all courses taught available upon request. Please email me.* 

**Excerpts from my Neurobiology discussion section reviews:**  

"Very good at explaining and answering questions. Direct and concise responses and helpful for those struggling with concepts."  

"She's an amazing TA, well-versed in the subject and she finds different ways to explain things until they are understood."  

"Lauren's quirky explanations made a lot more sense most of the time than the professor's. She is great at clarifying things that were presented in lecture in a non-intuitive manner. I appreciate her efforts and genuine desire to help students understand. She also wears the coolest socks sometimes."  

"Lauren was very funny and helpful. I liked her a lot as a TA and she made it clear which concepts were important and which concepts we were thinking too deeply about for the class. She kept discussion interesting. I would enjoy having her as a TA again! :) Thanks for all your help, Lauren!"  

"Thanks so much for your help, for being an amazing TA and for making NPB so much more interesting for me."
