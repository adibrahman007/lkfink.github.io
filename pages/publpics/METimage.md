**Call for Abstracts**
We are very pleased to announce this call for abstract submissions for the conference on “Music and Eye-tracking“ (MET17). Our goal is to bring together the leading experts from psychology, all fields of music research, sociology, cultural sciences, and neuroscience, united in the interest to investigate musical processing using eye-tracking methodology or combining eye-tracking with other methods.

Musical processing unfolds in different domains. One obvious application of eye-tracking methodology is music sight-reading, a field, where much progress has been made in the 20th century. During the last few years there seems to be growing enthusiasm to apply eye-tracking methodology to capture the full complexity of musical processing, extending to music perception, cognition, learning, skill-acquisition, expertise, performance, social interactions, rhythmic entrainment, emotion processing, induced states of altered awareness, and cross-modal interactions between the auditory, visual, or motoric systems, to name just a few examples.

With this conference, we hope to provide a platform for expert researchers at the intersection of music and eye-tracking to communicate with one another, to foster and enrich discussions about methods, and to continue refining models and theories of musical processing with insights from eye-tracking. We encourage researchers from other areas of cognition and emotion studies to join the interest in this complex question of investigation: what do eye movements, pupil dilation, and blinking activity tell us about musical processing?

We also like to encourage researchers of more basic questions to apply, e.g., research on cross-modal interactions, if their research might contribute to an understanding of music processing.

Note, we also plan a special issue on selected presentations of the conference with the focus on eye-movement research in the [Journal of Eye Movement Research](http://www.eyemovementresearch.com/).
