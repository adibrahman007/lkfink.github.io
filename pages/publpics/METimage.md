## Conference Information
We are very pleased to announce this conference on “Music and Eye-tracking“ (MET17), which will bring together the leading experts from psychology, all fields of music research, sociology, cultural sciences, and neuroscience, united in the interest to investigate musical processing using eye-tracking methodology or combining eye-tracking with other methods.

Musical processing unfolds in different domains. One obvious application of eye-tracking methodology is music sight-reading, a field, where much progress has been made in the 20th century. During the last few years there seems to be growing enthusiasm to apply eye-tracking methodology to capture the full complexity of musical processing, extending to music perception, cognition, learning, skill-acquisition, expertise, performance, social interactions, rhythmic entrainment, emotion processing, induced states of altered awareness, and cross-modal interactions between the auditory, visual, or motoric systems, to name just a few examples.

With this conference, we hope to provide a platform for expert researchers at the intersection of music and eye-tracking to communicate with one another, to foster and enrich discussions about methods, and to continue refining models and theories of musical processing with insights from eye-tracking. We have also invited researchers that apply more basic questions, e.g., research on cross-modal interactions. Together we will discuss the complex question: what do eye movements, pupil dilation, and blinking activity tell us about musical processing?
